# 🌾 AnnDaata AI - Crop Recommendation System

**AnnDaata AI** is a Machine Learning-based agricultural tool designed to help farmers choose the best crop for their soil conditions.

By analyzing soil nutrients (N, P, K) and weather parameters, the system uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict the most profitable crop to plant.

## 🚀 Features (Prototype)
* **Accurate Prediction:** Uses historical agricultural data to recommend crops.
* **Soil Analysis:** Takes Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, and pH levels as input.
* **Weather Integration:** Considers Temperature, Humidity, and Rainfall.
* **Multi-Language UI:** Basic support for English, Hindi, and Punjabi.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.9
* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **ML Model:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest)
* **Data Processing:** Pandas

## 🔮 Future Roadmap (To-Do)
We are working on upgrading this project with:
- [ ] **Generative AI Chatbot:** Integration with Google Gemini for personalized farming advice.
- [ ] **Voice Support:** Text-to-Speech for illiterate farmers.
- [ ] **Modern UI:** A better, theme-based user interface.
